Censord - a profanity checking web service.

Building
--------

Build and run with SBT:
    sbt update ~jetty-run

or Maven:
    mvn jetty:run

or with continuous deployment via SBT and JRebel:
    java -noverify -javaagent:[insert jrebel dir]/jrebel.jar -Xmx768M -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -jar [insert sbt dir]/sbt-launch.jar 
    jetty-run
    ~ prepare-webapp

Login
-----

Login is with OpenID - but since Google, Yahoo and others support OpenID, this shouldn't be too much of a barrier.

Once censord is running, then the first user who logs in will be tagged as allowed to administer the system. Subsequent
users need to be approved by an administrator.

Deploying to CloudBees
----------------------

CloudBees is a cloud platform-as-a-service for JVM webapps. It is currently free.

To deploy an instance of censord to CloudBees:

* Sign up for an account at https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/account/signup
* Create a new application on the CloudBees site
* Create a new database on the CloudBees site
* Edit src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml and comment in the jdbc/censord resource-ref
* Edit deploy.properties and set the database name, username and password to the values for the new CloudBees database
* Run mvn install
* On the CloudBees site, upload the generated WAR from the target/ directory

This will create a working censord instance.


Deploying to CloudBees repeatedly
---------------------------------

To easily deploy new versions to CloudBees repeatedly:

* Edit your ~/.m2/settings.xml to add:
    <pluginGroups>
        <pluginGroup>com.cloudbees</pluginGroup>
    </pluginGroups>

    <profiles>
        <profile>
           <id>cloudbees</id>
           <pluginRepositories>
             <pluginRepository>
               <id>bees-plugins-snapshots</id>
               <url>http://repository-cloudbees.forge.cloudbees.com/public-snapshot </url>
                <releases>
                    <enabled>true</enabled>
                </releases>
             </pluginRepository>
           </pluginRepositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>

    <activeProfiles>
       <activeProfile>cloudbees</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>

(adding to the existing pluginGroups, profiles, and activeProfiles elements if they already exist)

* From the CloudBees Account | Security Keys page, note your API key and secret key
* Run mvn com.cloudbees.bees:deploy -Dbees.appid=[appid] -Dbees.apikey=[apikey] -Dbees.secret=[secret]

This will build and deploy a new version of the application to CloudBees
