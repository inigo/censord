Censord - a profanity checking web service.

Building
--------

Build and run with SBT:
    sbt update ~jetty-run

or Maven:
    mvn jetty:run

or with continuous deployment via SBT and JRebel:
    java -noverify -javaagent:[insert jrebel dir]/jrebel.jar -Xmx768M -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -jar [insert sbt dir]/sbt-launch.jar 
    jetty-run
    ~ prepare-webapp

Login
-----

Login is with OpenID - but since Google, Yahoo and others support OpenID, this shouldn't be too much of a barrier.

Once censord is running, then the first user who logs in will be tagged as allowed to administer the system. Subsequent
users need to be approved by an administrator.
